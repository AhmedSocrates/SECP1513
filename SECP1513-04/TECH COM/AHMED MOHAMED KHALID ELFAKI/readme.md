| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | The data lecture was really interesting! I learned about cool jobs like data science and BI development. They showed how important data is for making smart decisions. I'm planning to become a software engineer in four years, and this lecture made me realize how much data and software go hand in hand. It's exciting to think about how technology is changing, and I'm eager to learn more about it in the coming years!  | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | The visit to Clarity Techworks was both joyful and educational. I now have a clear vision of the process of software development. I was able to see from the initial stage of the system implementation until the final stage before release ,it involves software developer until QA analyst. Not only that, I also gained the experience of the work life as i got the opportunity to engage in processes  such as coding, how to design the software, how to check the system before releases and much more. These experiences were really truly valuable in preparing me for the activities of the work life later on. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | Participating in the computer assembly lab was a practical boost for me as a computer science student. It allowed me to get hands-on experience with computer components, from collecting parts to assembling them. The lab bridged the gap between theory and application, enhancing my problem-solving skills and reinforcing the connection between hardware and software. The collaborative nature of the session also emphasized teamwork and communication, crucial skills in the professional world. Overall, this hands-on experience provided a valuable and comprehensive understanding of computer technology. |
